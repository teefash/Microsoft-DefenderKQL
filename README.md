This repository contains a collection of Kusto Query Language (KQL) scripts that Iâ€™ve used in the past for various analysis tasks, troubleshooting, and operational insights. 

 Purpose
 Archive of useful KQL scripts I've written or adapted.

 Reference for commonly used analytics or troubleshooting patterns.

 Assist with quick insights when working on new data analysis or security investigations.

 What Youâ€™ll Find
Reusable KQL queries organized by domain or use case.

Queries for:

Log Analytics

Microsoft Sentinel/XDR

Performance

Security incident investigation

Occasional notes or comments for context or customization.

Structure
The queries are organized in folders or files by topic, service, or use case (depending on how I've used them). File names and comments should provide enough context to reuse or adapt the queries.

ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer
These scripts are provided as-is. Some may require slight modification to work in your environment or with your specific data schema. Theyâ€™re intended for learning and quick reference

 Contributions
This is primarily a personal archive, but feel free to suggest improvements or share your own variations via issues or pull requests.
